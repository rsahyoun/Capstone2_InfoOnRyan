                        <h3 style="font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;">Coding and Curiosity</h3>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;"> I have always loved computers. I started coding in my senior year of high school, where I took a Java and Unity coding
                            course. Those high school classes inspired me to go further into the field and learn more in college. I then took two C++ classes during my first
                            year in college and started to self-teach JavaScript. I am currently teaching myself how to be a full-stack developer and hope to use these 
                            skills to land an internship or a job soon.

                        <h3 style="font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;">Space and Music</h3>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;"> I have a real knack for music, even if I never realized it at first. I first started with piano when I was
                            7 years old. I then joined my middle school's band with the baritone saxophone and loved it so much that I continued it in high school. I am currently practicing guitar in my 
                            free time and hope to improve more. Space is another subject that fascinates me, and even though I know only some fun facts, I would love to get more motivation to learn about it more.
